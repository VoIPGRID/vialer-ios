Google Analytics SDK for iOS Changelog

--------------------------------------------
Version: 3.10 (November 2014)
--------------------------------------------
* Fixed an issue which prevented all beacons from being sent when dispatching
  beacons.
* Updated CuteAnimals sample application to demonstrate how to dispatch when
  the app goes into the background.
* Added support for additional Enhanced Ecommerce fields.
* Removed warning messages about GAIHit and GAIProperty classes missing when
  compiling against iOS SDK 8.0; those classes were removed.
* Dispatching beacons is now more efficient, with multiple beacons being
  dispatched in a single HTTPS request.
* Requests will be compressed to save on data plan usage under certain
  circumstances.

Version: 3.08 (June 2014)
-------------------------------------------

  library libAdIdAccess.a (provided as part of the SDK) is included in the
  application and the allowIDFACollection property is set to true on the
  tracker.
* Enhanced Ecommerce support has been added.
* Added screenview hit type to replace appview hit type.
* A hit id parameter is now added to each hit.  It is changed every time an
  appview, screenview or pageview hit is generated.

  happens when idfa is collected in a tracker.

  with an empty clientId.

  set on the various fields instead.

  several parameters would only be set for the next send/track call.

  own custom logging for the SDK.

  this call will block until the client id can be read from the database.

  will use GET instead.
